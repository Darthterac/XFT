A tool for X that generates a followers list, can be copied exported as json for analytics or other uses, this scrapes the information from the x.com/user/followers page adding your followers to the list as the page is scrolled, so not really usefull for a large account unless you automate the scroll and let it capture ( polls every second ) 

Just copy the code and paste it in the URL of a bookmark and bobs your uncle. I used ChatGPT5.1 to help with portions of this - AI is a great mentor!
